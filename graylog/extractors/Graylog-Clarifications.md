# Graylog Clarificaitons

## Credits

The Cisco meraki Extractors is based on [Graylog-Meraki-Content-Pack](https://github.com/ddbnl/Graylog-Meraki-Content-Pack?tab=MIT-1-ov-file). While I have made modifications and enhancements, the original work by [ddbnl](https://github.com/ddbnl) was instrumental in shaping this project.
